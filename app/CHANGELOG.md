# Nuveli Changelog

## [1.6.9+32] - 2026-05-25 - Meal-planner recipe/grocery fix + recommendation typo

### Fixes
- **Recipe browser & shopping list stopped erroring** ("Tarifler yüklenemedi" /
  "An unexpected error occurred"). Prod's `recipes` table stores per-serving
  calories in a `calories` column, but the API model required
  `calories_per_serving`, so every recipe row failed validation → 500. Added a
  drift-mapping validator (`calories` → `calories_per_serving`) that also drops
  malformed ingredient entries; the grocery aggregator now skips non-object
  ingredients. (Backend — takes effect on Render deploy.) NOTE: `POST /recipes`
  is still mismatched (DB `calories` + NOT NULL `meal_types`) but testers only
  browse recipes, not create them — tracked separately.
- **Typo:** "7–8 saat uy" → "7–8 saat uyu" in the profile recommendations (TR).
  (App — ships in the next AAB.)

## [1.6.8+31] - 2026-05-25 - Fix launch crash (LateInitializationError)

### Fixes
- **Crash on launch — `LateInitializationError: Field '_authService' has
  already been initialized`** (reported by an Android tester on the welcome
  screen). `AuthNotifier` assigned its `late final` services inside `build()`,
  but an `AsyncNotifier`'s `build()` can re-run on the same instance (a
  dependency change or invalidation) — the second run re-assigned the
  `late final`s and threw. Moved the three services to lazy
  `late final … = ref.read(…)` field initializers (resolved once, immune to
  build re-runs) and cancel the auth-state subscription before re-subscribing
  so a rebuild can't leak a second listener.

## [1.6.7+30] - 2026-05-25 - Safe-pace onboarding guard + balanced-nutrition coaching

### Features (from tester feedback)
- **Onboarding safe-pace guard.** Step 4 (lose/gain goals) now asks a target
  date and gently flags an over-aggressive timeframe — lose > ~1 kg/week,
  gain > ~0.5 kg/week — offering a more sustainable date with one tap. Framed
  as general wellness guidance, never a clinical prescription
  (`docs/protocols/safety-wellness-boundary.md`). New pure `WeightPace` util
  (`core/utils/weight_pace.dart`, 8 unit tests). New l10n keys (7 locales).
- **Balanced-nutrition coaching.** The AI coach insight now detects a
  consistent macro skew (e.g. carb-heavy / low-protein week) and suggests
  concrete, accessible whole foods (a vegetable/fruit serving, a lean
  protein) — gentle balance guidance toward the user's goal, not a diet plan.
  Backend prompt (`coach_prompts.py`) — takes effect on Render deploy.

## [1.6.6+29] - 2026-05-25 - First Android tester round: weight-goal save, greeting name, coach empty

### Fixes
- **Weight-goal save no longer fails** with "Couldn't save. Check your
  connection." The partial UNIQUE index `idx_weight_goals_one_active` is on
  `is_active`, but the backend only flipped `status` on deactivate — the old
  goal kept `is_active = true`, so saving a second goal collided and 500'd.
  `create_goal` now flips `is_active` (the constraint column) and keeps
  `status` in sync. (Backend — takes effect on Render deploy.)
- **Dashboard greeting shows the user's name**, not the email local-part. It
  now reads the onboarding-entered profile name (same source as the Profile
  tab) instead of the empty auth `displayName` that fell back to e.g.
  "cfatihonal".
- **Coach hides the regenerate button in the empty state**, so a fresh user
  doesn't spend their one free daily regenerate on a no-data insight.

## [1.6.5+28] - 2026-05-25 - Play-readiness: auth-gate recovery, drop exact-alarm perms, repo cleanup

### Fixes
- **AuthGate no longer dumps logged-in users into onboarding on a profile-fetch
  error.** A transient backend/network error or an expired session previously
  rendered `OnboardingScreen` — letting a user re-onboard over an existing
  account. Now shows a retry screen (`AppErrorView`) whose retry re-evaluates
  both the profile and the auth session, so a truly-expired session falls back
  to the welcome/login screen. (A missing profile for a new user still comes
  back as `data: null` and correctly routes to onboarding.)
- **Dropped `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` / `USE_EXACT_ALARM` Android permissions.**
  Reminder scheduling already uses `AndroidScheduleMode.inexactAllowWhileIdle`,
  so exact alarms are unused; the permissions are stripped via
  `tools:node="remove"` (covering any merged in by flutter_local_notifications)
  to avoid Google Play's restricted-permission review.
- Brand wordmark image now carries a `semanticLabel: 'Nuveli'` for screen
  readers.

### Chore
- Removed untracked scratch files that polluted `flutter analyze`
  (`main_integration_snippet.dart`, `_chat19_gating_snippets.dart`, the
  `add_chunk*/fix_chunk*` one-shot scripts, `docs/chat18_*`, and the backend
  `_premium_gating_examples.py` / `auth_premium_additions.py` examples).
  `flutter analyze lib/` is now clean.

## [1.6.4+27] - 2026-05-25 - Brand refresh: smiling water-drop mark + Nuveli wordmark

### Features
- **Smiling water-drop brand mark** — a cute, elegant teardrop with kawaii
  eyes drawn in code (`SmilingDrop`, `shared/widgets/smiling_drop.dart`), so it
  scales crisply with no raster asset. Now used consistently everywhere a water
  drop appears: welcome screen, auth-gate loading, onboarding water target, and
  the dashboard water card (replacing the old `Icons.water_drop_outlined`).
- **Nuveli wordmark** — the designed glossy water lockup
  (`assets/icons/nuveli_wordmark.png`) replaces the plain text title on the
  welcome screen.
- Removed the unused Inter/Montserrat font scaffolding from pubspec.

## [1.6.3+26] - 2026-05-25 - i18n sweep: dashboard, manual-add sheet, analytics chart

### Fixes
- **Dashboard / manual-add / analytics i18n leaks** found during live iOS-sim
  QA. Migrated remaining hardcoded English to l10n (7 locales):
  - Today's-meals rows: meal-type label ("Snack"/"Breakfast") → reuse
    `mealType*` keys.
  - Weekly water card: "N/7 days on target" → `homeDaysOnTarget`.
  - Habits empty state: "No habits yet…" → `habitsEmptyDefaults`.
  - Manual "Add Food" sheet: meal-type chips → `mealType*`; field
    placeholders → `homeMealNameHint`, `homeCaloriesHint`.
  - Analytics weekly chart: weekday labels (Mon/Tue…) now use
    `DateFormat.E(locale)` instead of a hardcoded English list (mirrors the
    water chart).

Note: AI-generated content (scan food names, coach tips) is still English —
that's a backend-prompt change tracked separately, not a `.arb` edit.

## [1.6.2+25] - 2026-05-25 - Editable meal name on scan result

### Features
- **Editable "Meal name" field on the scan result screen.** Pre-filled with
  the auto-composed name (from detected foods) so there's a sensible default;
  the user can rename it (e.g. a Turkish title instead of the AI's English food
  name). Left blank → falls back to the auto name at save. New `mealName` field
  on `MealScanState` + `setMealName`; `autoMealName` getter centralizes the
  compose logic. l10n key `mealScanNameLabel` (7 locales).

## [1.6.1+24] - 2026-05-25 - Device-QA polish: coach empty state, paywall i18n, profile overflow

### Fixes
- **Profile daily-target card no longer overflows.** The "X kcal left today"
  line is wrapped in `Flexible`, so longer localized strings (RU/ES/FR run
  ~70px wider than EN) wrap instead of clipping into the progress donut — was
  a RenderFlex overflow of up to 82px, found during live iOS-sim QA.
- **Coach empty state.** A fresh user with no logged meals saw a red
  "0 / needs care / pick a tip below" score card pointing at tips that weren't
  there. Now shows a friendly "your coach is getting ready / log your first
  meal" empty state — no blame language, no dead-end. New l10n keys
  `coachEmptyTitle`, `coachEmptyBody` (7 locales).
- **Paywall "no packages" error is localized.** Replaced a hardcoded English
  string (shown under a Turkish title) with l10n key `paywallNoPackages`
  (7 locales).
- **Meal-scan i18n leaks.** The free-quota badge ("N/5 scans left today") and
  the meal-type chips ("Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snack") were hardcoded English
  on an otherwise Turkish screen. Badge now uses new keys `mealScanScansLeft`
  / `mealScanUnlimited` (built in the widget where a BuildContext is available,
  not in the model); chips reuse existing `mealType*` keys. Found during live
  iOS-sim scan QA.

## [1.6.0+23] - 2026-05-25 - Multilingual AI insight, recipe browser, cron monitoring, deep-link nav

### Backend
- **AI insight now respects the user's language.** Added `profiles.language`
  (migration `020`, drift-safe) + `PATCH /me` support; the daily/on-demand
  coach insight prompt instructs the model to respond entirely in the user's
  language (en/tr/de/es/fr/it/ru), falling back to English. (Migration must be
  applied to prod Supabase manually; code degrades to English until then.)
- **Cron errors now reach Sentry** — `daily_insights_job`, `achievement_checker`,
  `streak_resetter` forward per-user/job exceptions via `capture_exception`
  (previously logger-only). Backend suite: 139 → 155 passing.

### Features
- **Recipe browser** in the meal planner (`GET /recipes`, empty-safe) — tap a
  recipe to add it to a plan day (`createPlanEntryFromRecipe`).
- **App language now syncs to the backend** (`PATCH /me {language}`) when changed
  in Settings, so server-generated insights match the UI language.
- **Notification-tap navigation** — tapping a push/local notification switches to
  the right bottom-nav tab (minimal `NotificationNavNotifier`, no router rewrite).

### i18n
- Migrated remaining stragglers (notification settings screen, habit error,
  coach action CTAs). +66 keys × 7 locales.

### Tests
- flutter: 497 → **503**. analyze clean. pytest 155 passed / 8 skipped.

### Notes
- Dashboard (`/analytics/dashboard`) and Coach (`/coach/today`) intentionally
  remain separate sources — no redundant fetch (documented in code).

## [1.5.0+22] - 2026-05-24 - Full 7-language UI (i18n migration)

### Features
- **The app is now genuinely multilingual.** Previously the l10n system
  (delegates + .arb) was activated but only 3 surfaces used it — every other
  screen rendered hardcoded English regardless of language. Migrated all
  user-facing screens to `AppLocalizations`:
  - Settings (+ **a real language picker** — the in-app switcher that was
    missing; `changeLanguage()` was dead code with no UI)
  - Coach, Dashboard/home (header, summary, macros, water, meals, add-food,
    bottom nav), Meal scan + Meal planner, Profile + Analytics,
    Auth + onboarding.
- All strings localized across **7 locales** (en, tr, de, es, fr, it, ru);
  ~190 new keys added on top of the existing ~585. Locale-aware dates via
  `initializeDateFormatting()`.
- Verified on the iOS simulator end-to-end: switching to Turkish renders the
  dashboard, nav, summary, macros, water, and greeting in Turkish.

### Notes
- Dynamic/data strings (AI-generated insight text, recipe/meal names from the
  API) are intentionally not localized — they come from the backend.
- A few deep/rarely-seen strings may remain; they fall back to English and
  can be picked up incrementally.

## [1.4.1+21] - 2026-05-24 - Fix release-build black screen (Android-first config)

### Fix
- **P0 launch crash:** `AppConfig.isProductionConfigValid` required *both*
  `RC_APPLE_KEY` and `RC_GOOGLE_KEY` to be non-empty. The Android-first
  release ships no Apple key (iOS paused), so the guard failed and `main()`
  threw a `StateError` before `runApp` → **black screen on launch**. Now it
  needs only the current platform's RC key (at least one present). The
  per-platform key is still selected at runtime in `RevenueCatService`.

## [1.4.0+20] - 2026-05-24 - Meal history + placeholder polish + i18n slice

### Features
- **Meal history screen** — the dashboard "See all" now opens a full meal
  history (was a "Chat 17 coming soon" toast). `GET /meals` paginated
  (newest first), grouped by day with per-day totals, swipe-to-delete with
  a confirm dialog and dashboard refresh. New repo `getMealHistory`.

### Polish
- **Welcome logo** uses the real brand mark (`assets/icons/splash_logo.png`)
  instead of the water-drop placeholder (graceful fallback if it can't load).
- **Google sign-in button** gets a clean white-circle "G" badge instead of
  the thin `g_mobiledata` glyph.

### i18n (incremental)
- Localized the new meal-history screen across all 7 locales (4 new
  `mealHistory*`/`historyYesterday` keys; delete dialog + Today reuse
  existing keys). First slice of the broader hardcoded-string migration now
  that l10n is active — meal-planner sheets, settings, and dashboard remain
  hardcoded EN and are the next incremental targets.

### Tests
- +4 host tests: `getMealHistory` pagination contract + `groupMealsByDay`.
  493 → 497 passing.

## [1.3.0+19] - 2026-05-24 - Meal Planner write side (F4 v0.1)

### Features
- **Manual add-to-plan** — a "+" on each day (and an "Add manually" CTA on
  the empty state) opens a sheet to add a custom meal: meal type, date,
  name, calories (entry total), optional macros, servings, note →
  `POST /meal-plans`.
- **Edit entry** — tap an entry → Edit name/note (`PATCH /meal-plans/{id}`).
  Servings/calorie changes go through delete + re-add, because the backend
  PATCH path does not recompute totals on a servings change (documented in
  the repo + edit sheet).
- **Delete entry** — tap → Remove, with a confirm dialog (`DELETE`).
- **AI generate sheet** — replaces the v0 "coming soon" snackbar with a
  real dietary-preferences sheet (dietary preference, avoid ingredients,
  calorie target prefilled from profile, meals/day) → `POST /meal-plans/generate`.
  Premium-gated upstream.
- Write actions are gated to weeks the user can view (free = current week);
  the read paths, week navigator, and grocery list are unchanged.

### Tests
- +9 host tests: repository request-contract (POST/PATCH/DELETE payload
  keys + paths, mocktail) and the add sheet (validation + typed create
  call). 484 → 493 passing.

### Notes
- Recipe browser intentionally deferred — it only adds value once the
  prod `recipes` table is confirmed populated (seeded in migration 013,
  but prod state unverified). Custom entry covers the core need.

## [1.2.1+18] - 2026-05-24 - Revert debug exception leak (launch blocker)

### Security
- `backend/main.py` unhandled-exception handler no longer returns the
  `_debug_exc` field (exception class + truncated message) in 500
  response bodies. It was added intentionally for live-prod QA without
  Render dashboard access; exposing exception class names is a soft
  information-disclosure issue (can leak schema/internal names) and had
  to come out before store submission. Full trace is still logged
  server-side. Backend suite: 139 passed / 8 skipped.

## [1.2.0+17] - 2026-05-24 - Local coach mood bubbles + i18n activation

### Features
- **Mood-bubble layer** (`lib/features/coach/mood/`) — a local,
  zero-OpenAI persona layer on top of the daily Coach insight. Fires an
  instant, on-device bubble at real user moments:
  - **Meal save** — situation derived from today's post-save totals:
    first meal / under target / on track / over target.
  - **Water-low** — nudge after a water add if still behind target past
    14:00.
  - **Streak milestone** — celebrates 3/7/14/21/30/50/100/365-day
    streaks, de-duped per value via `MoodSeenStore` so it fires once.
  - 4 personas (gentle / funny / direct / calm) × 6 situations = 24
    copy lines, localized in all 7 shipped locales. Over-target copy
    follows the wellness boundary (no shame, no deficit drama, no
    compensation framing).
- **Coach persona picker** in Settings (`coachToneQuestion` + the
  long-dormant `personaGentle/Funny/Direct/Calm` strings, finally wired).
  Local-only (SharedPreferences); never round-trips to the backend.

### Infrastructure
- **Activated app-wide localization.** `MaterialApp` now wires
  `localizationsDelegates` + `supportedLocales` + a `locale` driven by
  `globalLanguageNotifier`, and `main()` calls `preloadLanguage()`. The
  690 existing `.arb` keys and the in-app language switcher were built but
  never connected to the runtime — they are now live. (Screens still
  using hardcoded English strings are unaffected until individually
  migrated.)

### Tests
- +24 host tests: situation detection (meal/water/streak), copy-bank
  resolution across locales, persona persistence. 460 → 484 passing.

## [1.1.1+16] - 2026-05-24 - Session handoff doc refresh

### Docs
- `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` rewritten as of 2026-05-24 ~13:30 TRT:
  enumerate every fix this session shipped (schema drifts, signup
  bypass, auth popUntil, water freeze, RC iOS guards, profile edit,
  Coach pipeline cron + FCM, dashboard kcal parse), Render env state
  after Firebase setup, full live-endpoint smoke log, and a 7-item
  next-session priority list. Mood-bubble flagged as #1 (Ali asked
  twice). Debug exc revert flagged as launch-blocker #2.
- Memory: `project_coach_pipeline_live.md` snapshot — what's wired,
  what env is set on Render, and the iOS-sim APNS gap so next session
  doesn't think push is broken.

No code changes.

## [1.1.0+15] - 2026-05-24 - Coach pipeline: cron + push (A→B→C)

### Backend
- **A.** APScheduler wired in `main.py` lifespan. Daily at 02:00 UTC
  it calls `cron.daily_insights_job.run_for_all_users()` which generates
  a fresh Coach insight for every active user. Default ON; turn off with
  `APP_ENABLE_INTERNAL_CRON=false` if you switch to Option B (Render
  Cron Service — see `docs/ops/cron.md`).
- **B.** `docs/ops/cron.md` — Render Cron Service setup, smoke-test
  command, env list, cost-guard math, and Phase-C wiring notes.
- **C.** `services/fcm_service.py` — FCM v1 push helper. Gated on
  `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` + `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_B64`; no-ops
  silently when env missing. Prunes UNREGISTERED / INVALID_ARGUMENT
  tokens lazily. Daily-insights job calls `send_to_user` with
  `data={"route": "/coach", "kind": "daily_insight"}` so the tap
  payload can deep-link.
- `POST /me/device-tokens` and `DELETE /me/device-tokens/{token}` —
  Flutter calls these on sign-in / sign-out / `onTokenRefresh`. Dedup
  is server-side: an existing token row is deleted before re-insert so
  a token migrating users (rare but real) doesn't double-fire.
- `google-auth==2.34.0` added to requirements (only required when FCM
  env is present at runtime; httpx was already pinned).

### Flutter
- `core/notifications/fcm_token_register.dart` — minimal glue that
  requests permission (iOS), fetches token, POSTs to backend, and
  subscribes to `onTokenRefresh`. Cancels on sign-out and DELETEs the
  token so the backend stops addressing the device.
- `main.dart` `_wireAuthRevenueCatSync` now also fires FCM register /
  unregister inside a separate try block — RC failure (dev build w/o
  RC_APPLE_KEY) doesn't skip push registration.

### What's still needed (one-time, Ali's hands)
- Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service accounts →
  Generate private key → base64 → set
  `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` + `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_B64` on the
  Render backend service. Cron + Flutter side are both ready and idle
  until those env vars land.

## [1.0.4+14] - 2026-05-23 - Profile edit + water-test rewrite

### Features
- **Profile edit screen** — settings gear in `ProfileHeader` now opens
  `ProfileEditScreen` instead of debug-printing. Form covers name, sex,
  date of birth, height, weight, activity level, dietary preference;
  ships only changed fields to `PATCH /me` then invalidates
  profileProvider so the goals screen re-fetches.

### Tests
- Rewrote `water_quick_card_test.dart` to match the new chip-only
  picker (the "Custom (ml)" TextField was removed in 1.0.3 for the
  iOS freeze fix; the tests were still poking at it). 4 obsolete
  tests → 4 new tests covering the widened preset set + 1000 ml
  chip dispatch. 458 → 460 passing.

## [1.0.3+13] - 2026-05-23 - Sprint A live-device QA pass

### Features
- F1 AI Meal Scan UI (#124) — camera/gallery, preview/retake, rotating
  progress text, editable result with per-food + scale slider, premium
  gate (5/day free) routes to paywall.
- F2 AI Coach insight surface (#128) — 6th bottom-nav tab. Nutrition
  score arc, today's coaching paragraph, tip list with all 8 backend
  `TipIcon` glyphs, one-tap `recommended_action` apply.
- F4 Meal Planner v0 (#129) — read-only weekly view, day cards, grocery
  bottom sheet, premium paywall for past/future weeks. Manual add and
  AI generate land in v0.1.

### Bug fixes (live-device QA found)
- **Signup SMTP bypass** — Supabase's default mailer rate-limits at
  ~2/hr; users got stuck on "verify your email" with no mail ever
  arriving. New `POST /auth/signup` mints users with
  `email_confirm=True` via the service-role admin API; Flutter calls
  it then `signInWithPassword`. Revert path documented in the router.
- **iOS RC native fatal** — `Purchases.*` calls on an unconfigured SDK
  raised a Swift `fatalError` (SIGTRAP) that no Dart try/catch could
  recover. Every `RevenueCatService` method now guards on
  `_initialized` and returns falsy when the SDK was skipped.
- **Auth screens didn't pop** — `signUpWithEmail` / `signInWithEmail`
  / Apple / Google now `popUntil(isFirst)` so AuthGate becomes
  visible with the new session.
- **Habits schema drift adapter** — prod table uses `title`,
  `display_order`, `schedule_type`, `days_of_week TEXT[]`, plus a
  NOT NULL `habit_type` (default `check`). Router translates between
  the public API contract and the actual columns on every path; enum
  values outside Literal normalize to safe defaults.
- **Coach `daily_recap` NOT NULL** — `ai_insights` row insert was
  500ing because the prompt didn't yet produce a recap field. We
  dump the full payload under a `summary` key as a placeholder.
- **Meals `notes` column drift** — prod table has no `notes`; POST
  body now strips that field plus other nulls.
- **Weight goals `status` enum** — `cancelled` violated the prod
  check constraint; the deactivate-old-goal path now writes
  `abandoned`.
- **Dashboard TodaySummary `consumed_*` parse** — backend ships
  `consumed_calories` / `daily_calorie_target` / `meal_count_today`;
  Flutter model was reading the older `calories_consumed` etc keys
  and seeing 0. Both spellings now accepted.
- **Water portion-picker freeze** — focusing the "Custom (ml)"
  TextField inside the bottom sheet triggered an infinite-width
  BoxConstraints cascade that killed the simulator. TextField
  removed; preset list widened to 11 options (100…1000 ml).
- **insights_generation_service habits select** — was reading
  `habits.name`; switched to `id` only (we don't need title at the
  insight-aggregate level).

### Tooling
- `backend/scripts/confirm_user_email.py` — flip
  `email_confirmed_at` for any account via service-role admin API.
- `backend/scripts/seed_reviewer_account.py` — bug fix
  (`init_supabase()` returns None → use `get_supabase()`).
- `backend/main.py` exception handler temporarily leaks
  `_debug_exc` (class + truncated message) in 500 responses so we
  can diagnose prod issues without Render dashboard access. **Must
  revert before App Store / Play Store submit** (tracked as
  Task #43).

### Tests
- 410 → 461+ host tests (+51): scan models, scan-count gate, coach
  insight JSON, tip-icon mapping for all 8 backend values,
  regen-gate transitions, planner JSON, gate transitions.
